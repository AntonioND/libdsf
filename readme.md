# LibDSF

## 1. Introduction

This is a library written in C to render text from fonts generated by
[BMFont](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/). The name of the library
(LibDSF) comes from "DS Font library".

In order to use this library, download the **Bitmap Font Generator** tool (or
any other compatible tool), export the font image to PNG, and export the font
data in binary format.

This library can load font data from RAM or from the filesystem. It won't load
textures for you, you're in charge of converting the PNG files to a
DS-compatible format and loading them to RAM (and VRAM).

Currently, only fonts with one single PNG file are supported.

## 2. Install

Simply run this to build and install the library in your BlocksDS environment:

```bash
make install
```

## 3. Example

Once you have installed the library, go to the folder of the example and run:

```bash
make
```

This will generate a NDS file that you can test with flashcards or emulators.

## License

This library is released under the Zlib license.
