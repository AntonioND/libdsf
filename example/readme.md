This font has been generated with the 64-bit version of AngelCode's Bitmap Font
Generator.

The `bmfc` files with the configuration have been saved to this folder.

The `fnt` files have been moved to the `data` folder and renamed to have `bin`
as extension, so that it is recognized by the build system.

The `png` files have been moved to the `graphics` folder, and `grit`
configuration files have been added so that they are converted to a NDS texture
format.
