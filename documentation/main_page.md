LibDSF documentation {#mainpage}
====================

## Introduction

This is a library written in C to render text from fonts generated by
[BMFont](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/).

In order to use this library, download the **Bitmap Font Generator** tool (or
any other compatible tool), export the font image to PNG, and export the font
data in binary format.

This library can load font data from RAM or from the filesystem. It won't load
textures for you, you're in charge of converting the PNG files to a
DS-compatible format and loading them to RAM (and VRAM).

Currently, only fonts with one single PNG file are supported.
